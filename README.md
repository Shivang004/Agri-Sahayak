## Workflow:

1. **User Interaction**: A farmer interacts with the platform's frontend, submitting a query in their preferred language, which could include text and images.

2. **API Communication**: The Next.js frontend sends the query to the backend's /api/query endpoint.

3. **Coordination**: The Sarpanch (Coordinator Agent) receives the query. It acts as the central hub, managing the entire workflow.

4. **Planning**: The Sarpanch passes the query to the Planner Agent, which breaks down the complex query into a sequence of specific tasks.

5. **Task Delegation**: The Sarpanch reviews the plan and dispatches each task to the most suitable specialist agent from the team.

6. **Specialist Execution**: Each specialist agent executes its task using a shared set of tools, which interface with external APIs and internal knowledge bases.

7. **Data Aggregation**: The specialist agents return their findings to the Sarpanch, which collects and aggregates all the information.

8. **Response Synthesis**: The Sarpanch forwards the aggregated data to the Response Agent, which synthesizes a coherent, comprehensive, and user-friendly answer in the user's original language.

9. **Final Output**: The synthesized response is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the farmer.

## Features
### Frontend
- üåç Multi-Language Support: Supports English, Hindi, Punjabi, Marathi, Telugu, and Tamil, with complete UI localization.

- üìä Market Data Visualization: Interactive charts for commodity price trends and market quantities with robust filtering.

- üå§Ô∏è Weather Forecast & Insights: Real-time, agriculture-specific weather data and smart insights using the Open-Meteo API.

- üí¨ AI Chat Interface: A multi-language chat interface with voice input/output capabilities for seamless interaction.

### Backend

- **Crop Health Analysis**: Multi-modal image analysis for plant disease diagnosis.

- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive endpoints for both conversational AI and direct data access.

### The Multi-Agent Team
The backend's intelligence is driven by a team of specialized AI agents, each with a distinct role.

- **Sarpanch (Coordinator)**: The master agent that oversees the entire process. It receives the initial query, manages the workflow by coordinating with the planner and specialists, and ensures a final, high-quality response is generated.

- **Planner Agent**: The strategist of the team. It analyzes the user's query and creates a step-by-step plan for the specialist agents to follow.

- **Vayu (Weather Specialist)**: Provides detailed weather forecasts, historical data, and climate information relevant to farming activities.
